# Day 4 Learning about Array in Js (25th May 2024):

- Array is used to store multiple items under a single variable.
- Array is object data types.
- JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types.
- JS Arrays are zero-indexed.
- JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (Means give as reference. If we change value origin value will be changed.)

### We can assign array in many ways:
- > `No-1. => const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- > `No-2. => const array2 = ["Anuj", "Anir", "Earth"]`
- > `No-3. => const array3 = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4)`
