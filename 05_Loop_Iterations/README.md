## Constiniuning Day 9: `For` loop
<hr>

> 
     loops are known as `iterations`. 
     The break statement `jumps out` of a loop. 
     The continue statement `jumps over` one iteration in the loop. 
     The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

- In object we will use `for in` loop
- In array we will use `for of` loop
- `forEach()` did not return any thing bydefault. 
- for return we have to use `filter()`.

## reduce():
-  used to reduce an array to a single value by passing a callback function on each element of the array.

- The reduce() method executes a reducer function for array element.

- The reduce() method returns a single value: the function's accumulated result.

- The reduce() method does not execute the function for empty array elements.

- The reduce() method does not change the original array.
