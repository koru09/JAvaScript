## Constiniuning Day 9: `For` loop
<hr>

- loops are known as `iterations`.
- The break statement `jumps out` of a loop.
- The continue statement `jumps over` one iteration in the loop.
- The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.
